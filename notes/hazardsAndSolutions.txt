=======================================


init process:
  server:
    send init command to each host
  each host:
    pi:
      read position from abs encoder
      send position to server
  server:
    collect all positions
    calculate safe order of expansion
    send intitial_expand command to each host with paramater for distance
  each host:
    pi:

    move distance ( in expand direction )
    double-check with abs and inc encoder
    [ send current and fault data ]
    send confirmation of initial_expand
  server:
    collect all initial_expand confirmations
    send zero_inc_encoder command to all hosts
  each host:
    zero incremental encoder
    read encoder value and verify it is ( close enough to ) zero
    send confirmation to server, with inc and abs encoder values
  server:
    collect zero_inc_encoder confirmations
  READY???  ANYTHING ELSE???

expand/contract process:
  server:
    send check_if_ready command to all hosts
  each host:
    check that encoder values correspond
    check for any motor faults
    ??? any othe tests ???
    send confirmations to server
  server
    collect all check_if_ready confirmations 
    start animation, sending timed series of expand/contract commands to each host with speed and max position
    listen for deadmanswitch messages from each host
  each host:
    upon recieving expand/contract command send command to motor controller
      assuming mode is "closed loop speed position":
        check motor for faults
        check abs and inc encoder positions
        check encoder values correspond and match expectations
        send motion command to controller
        poll inc encoder and stop at correct time
          Can this be precise given the delays in polling?
          Can this be set up some other way in the controller?  Min/Max values?

        stop conditions for pi:
          stop message from server
          loss of deadmanswitch signal from the server
          encoder value conflict
        stop conditions for controller:
          loss of serial safety signal from the pi
          inc encoder passes beyond min/max values

in case of exceptions:
  
====================================

deadman switches:

  controller->host:
    replies to noop/status queries ( ack / nak ), or whatever equialent

  host->controller:
    serial safety setting on controller

  host->server:
    deadman switch messages

  host->server
    deadman switch messages

can the system run at a time resolution of 0.1s?
